### Elision is a point-and-click adventure web game that allows you to play as a refugee smuggler in the Sahara region of Africa.
The project explores the topic of migration and the surrounding historical, political, economic, and social context that causes it, using real-life stories to promote a healthier narrative of immigrants as individuals seeking to find refuge from socio-political disasters, rather than as a group of nameless, suffering victims deserving of pity or scorn.

Video games have been shown to be an engaging, digestible way to spread messages and enact change; they have been specifically selected for this project because of their ability to synthesize people, locations, histories, stories and social structures together to better convey context of why the immigration crisis is so large. The hope is that players will learn best by engaging with the game, making difficult decisions, and in the end, drawing conclusions for themselves.

Showcased at the Design, Cultures, and Creativity honors college capstone fair 2019.
